        <p>
            Our project intends to connect students with study spots at <a href="https://www.washington.edu/about/seattle-campus/">UW Seattle</a>.
            With more than a dozen libraries and even more buildings available to study in, UW has the perfect space for any given student. 
            Whether you thrive in a collaborative or silent environment, and whether your taste leans toward a modern or traditional aesthetic, 
            there is definitely a spot suitable for you. But given the university’s 700-acre campus, many of these study spots may be underutilized 
            and/or unheard of. Students are generally concentrated in popular buildings like Odegaard, the HUB, Suzzallo and Allen. As great as they 
            are, they fill up quickly whereas lesser known spots may have a plethora of space available. There is currently no resource that conveniently 
            provides information on places to study for UW students. <a href="https://scout.uw.edu/seattle/">UW Scout</a> is an existing 
            attempt at informing students on study spots the campus has to offer. While it shares helpful information including business hours, 
            resource availability, location, and reservation details, it focuses almost exclusively on libraries and lacks information on the abundance 
            of other spots UW students are free to study in.

            <h2>App Description</h2>
        </header>

        <p>The target users of our application are UW Seattle students. Users will be able to perform three main functions on our application:</p>

        <section>
        <ul>
            <li>Take a quiz to find the most suitable study spot for them</li>
            <li>Upload new study areas to our database</li>
            <li>Leave reviews for study spots</li>
        </ul>
        </section>

        <p>
            Additionally, users will be able to browse and filter study areas by different attributes such as noise level, busyness, type of building,
            and accessibility. Users will see information about available study spaces at UW, including pictures of the study space and reviews that 
            other users have left.
        </p>

        <p>
            This application will allow UW Seattle students to find existing study areas as well as discover new areas to study. This will alleviate 
            the overwhelming feelings of navigating UW’s large campus by providing a centralized database of both established study areas and hidden 
            gems. The quiz feature will ensure that users find the best study space for their needs based on their preferences. The uploading feature 
            will highlight lesser known study areas that are favorites among UW students, encouraging users to explore the underused study spaces 
            across UW. The review feature will inform users of what other students think of various study spaces. Our application is created for students, 
            by students to ensure that everyone has access to all the study spaces that UW provides.
